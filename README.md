# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description for the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Erlang language.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

Visual Studio Code - Very useful for writing code. Here are some of the extensions I used...
* Erlang
* Live Server
* etc...

I used the Erlang language for this code. Here are libraries that I used: 
* io - used for printing the screen
* lists - used for some functions involving lists
You could also say that I use the HTML and Markdown languages because my program is a (incomplete) Markdown to HTML converter.
